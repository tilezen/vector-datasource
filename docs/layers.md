# Layers in Tilezen's vector tiles

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-all-layers.png)

The [Tilezen vector tiles](https://mapzen.com/projects/vector-tiles) provides worldwide basemap coverage sourced from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) and other open data projects, updated intermittently as a free & shared service at [Nextzen.org](http://www.nextzen.org).

Data is organized into several thematic layers, each of which is named, for example; `buildings`, `pois`, and `water`. A selection of these layers are typically used for base map rendering, and are provided under the short-hand name `all`. Each layer includes a simplified view of OpenStreetMap data for easier consumption, with common tags often condensed into a single `kind` field as noted below.

Need help displaying vector tiles in a map? Here are several [examples](display-tiles.md) using Tilezen vector tiles to style in your favorite graphics library including Tangram, Mapbox GL, D3, and OpenLayers.

### Overview

#### Data sources and attribution

Tilezen primarily sources from OpenStreetMap, but includes a variety of other open data. For a full listing, view the [data sources](data-sources.md). Each source may require [attribution](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/blob/master/docs/attribution.md) in your project.

#### Feature names

Most Tilezen vector tile features include a basic name property (`common`):

* `name` - Generally the name the locals call the feature, in the local script.

It supports several additional name related properties (`optional`):

* `alt_name`
* `int_name`
* `loc_name`
* `name:short` - For example: `CA` for California. _See planned bug fix [#1102](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1102) and see planned bug fix [#1094](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1094) for abbreviated names._
* `name_left`
* `name_right`
* `nat_name`
* `official_name`
* `old_name`
* `reg_name`
* `short_name`

#### Name localization

Tilezen includes all language variants of the `name:*` values to enable full internationalization (when different from `name`).

Language variants are identified by an ISO 639-1 two-letter language code and optional country code, for example `en` for English and less commonly `en_GB` for British English. Mapzen [house styles](https://mapzen.com/products/maps/) designed in Tangram support displaying all language scripts.

We additionally localize `alt_name:*` and `old_name:*` properties for features across all layers.

For features in the `boundaries` layer, there are two additional variants `name:left` and `name:right` to support oriented labeling on the appropriate side of the boundary line (so the labeled polygon's text can appear inside that polygon consistently). _See planned bug fix [#1102](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1102)._

**Localized name properties** (`common-optional`)**:**

* `name:*`
* `alt_name:*`
* `old_name:*`
* `name:left:*` _See planned bug fix [#1102](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1102)._
* `name:right:*` _See planned bug fix [#1102](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1102)._

##### Chinese name localization

We populate two fields for Chinese variants based on [ISO 15924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924) codes::

* `name:zh-Hans`: Simplified Chinese
* `name:zh-Hant`: Traditional Chinese

Both `name:zh-Hans` and `name:zh-Hant` properties are best-effort. It means `name:zh-Hans` can sometimes contain Traditional Chinese and `name:zh-Hant` can sometimes contain Simplified Chinese. And we don't auto-translate Traditional Chinese to Simplified Chinese or vice versa.

The `name:zh` field is now deprecated. But for backward-compatibility we also populate it, and this field is Simplified Chinese most time but can also be Traditional Chinese. Don't rely on this field.

If Tilezen cannot find any Chinese properties in the predefined list of each provider (see below), none of `name:zh`, `name:zh-Hans` or `name:zh-Hant` will be populated.

###### OSM

We use several tags from OSM to populate the two properties:

* `name:zh-Hans`: Simplified Chinese
* `name:zh-SG`: Simplified Chinese
* `name:zh`: Simplified/Traditional Chinese
* `name:zh-Hant`: Traditional Chinese
* `name:zh-Hant-tw`: Traditional Chinese
* `name:zh-Hant-hk`: Traditional Chinese
* `name:zh-yue`: Traditional Chinese
* `name:zh-HK`: Traditional Chinese

We first try to use OSM tag `name:zh-Hans` to populate `name:zh-Hans` and OSM tag `name:zh-Hant` to populate `name:zh-Hant`, but if they are not available we parse other OSM tags such as `name:zh-SG`, `name:zh-Hant-tw`, `zh-Hant-hk`, `name:zh-yue`, `name:zh-HK`, `name:zh` to backfill them. After the backfilling, if either one is still missing, we will use the other variant to further backfill, i.e. Traditional Chinese can be used to backfill `name:zh-Hans` or Simplified Chinese can be used to backfill `name:zh-Hant`.


###### WhosOnFirst

We use several properties to populate Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese with the following priority (first priority is at the top):

Simplified Chinese
* `name:zho_cn_x_preferred`
* `name:zho_x_preferred`
* `name:wuu_x_preferred`

Traditional Chinese
* `name:zho_tw_x_preferred`
* `name:zho_x_variant`

If either variant is missing, we will use the other variant to backfill, i.e. Traditional Chinese can be used to backfill `name:zh-Hans` or Simplified Chinese can be used to backfill `name:zh-Hant`.


###### NaturalEarth

We use two properties to populate Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese:

Simplified Chinese
* `name_zh`

Traditional Chinese
* `name_zht`

If either variant is missing, we will use the other variant to backfill, i.e. Traditional Chinese can be used to backfill `name:zh-Hans` or Simplified Chinese can be used to backfill `name:zh-Hant`.


#### Geometry types

Individual Tilezen vector tile layers can include mixed geometry types. This is common in the `landuse`, `water`, and `buildings` layers.

A tile geometry can be one of three types:

* Point, MultiPoint
* LineString, MultiLineString
* Polygon, MultiPolygon

In Tangram, Mapzen's GL graphics library, the keyword `$geometry` matches the feature's geometry type, for cases when a FeatureCollection includes more than one type of geometry. Valid geometry types are:

* `point`: matches Point, MultiPoint
* `line`: matches LineString, MultiLineString
* `polygon`: matches Polygon, MultiPolygon

**Tangram scene file examples:**

```
filter: { $geometry: polygon }            # matches polygons only
filter: { $geometry: [point, line] }      # matches points & lines
filter: function() { return $geometry === 'line' }  # matches lines
```

Mapnik supports geometry filtering via the special `mapnik::geometry_type` keyword.

**CartoCSS Examples:**

```
#layer['mapnik::geometry_type'=1] { /* point styles */ }
#layer['mapnik::geometry_type'=2] { /* line styles */ }
#layer['mapnik::geometry_type'=3] { /* polygon styles */ }
```

#### Data updates

Most Tilezen vector tile content is updated minutely from OpenStreetMap. Low and mid-zoom tiles are updated approximately monthly. Some source data rarely updates – Natural Earth updates approximately yearly.

#### Changelog

The current version of Tilezen vector tile data schema is **v1.9.0**.

Tiles are still in active development, but Tilezen promises to minimize backwards incompatible breaking changes. Data model promises are listed in the Tilezen [SEMANTIC VERSIONING](https://github.com/mapzen/vector-datasource/tree/master/SEMANTIC-VERSIONING.md) statement.

You can send your feedback at hello@nextzen.org or via our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/tilezen/tilezen-chat) room.

Read the full details in the project [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mapzen/vector-datasource/tree/v1.6.0/CHANGELOG.md).

#### Feature ordering

Ordering of features - which ones draw "on top of" other features - can be an important feature of display maps. To help out with this, there is a `sort_rank` property on some features which suggests in what order the features should appear. Lower numbers mean that features should appear "towards the back" and higher numbers mean "towards the front". These numbers are consistent across layers. The layers which include `sort_rank` on their features are: `boundaries`, `buildings`, `earth`, `landuse`, `roads`, `transit` and `water`.

To facilitate **data visualization** overlays and underlays, the following client-side `order` ranges are suggested:

* `0-9`: Under everything. _Tip: disable earth layer._
* `190-199`: Under water. Above earth and most landuse.
* `290-299`: Under roads. Above borders, water, landuse, and earth. **Your classic "underlay".**
* `490-499`: Over all line and polygon features. Under map labels (icons and text), under UI elements (like routeline and search result pins). **Your classic raster map overlay.**

**Tangram scene file example:**

```
draw:
    polygons:
        order: 490
```

### Layer reference

Tilezen vector tiles include 9 default layers (and 2 optional layers):

* `boundaries`, `buildings`, `earth`, `landuse`, `places`, `pois`, `roads`, `transit`, and `water`

These individual layers are grouped into an `all` layer – use this special layer for all your general purpose mapping needs.

While the service can return just a single layer or combination of layers, the `all` layer is more performant.

The Tilezen vector tiles schema defines 2 optional layers:

* `traffic_flow` and `traffic_incidents`


## Boundaries

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-boundaries.png)

* Layer name: `boundaries`
* Geometry types: `line`

Combination of OpenStreetMap administrative boundaries (zoom >= 8) and Natural Earth boundaries (zoom < 8).


#### Boundaries properties (common):

* `name`: A suggested label, formed from the left and right region names, if available. If the name appears to be too long to be rendered on the geometry at a particular zoom it may be omitted.
* `id`: Identifier for the feature, only provided at zoom 13+.
* `kind`: mapping of OpenStreetMap's `admin_level` int values to strings like `country` and `state`, plus `aboriginal_lands` boundary type, and also includes normalized Natural Earth values. To handle disagreements about the location of borders, the `kind` may be prefixed with `unrecognized_`, e.g: `unrecognized_country`, for some differing viewpoints (see `kind:xx` below).
* `kind_detail`: mapping of OpenStreetMap's `admin_level` values. `2` for countries, `4` for regions, and `6`, `8` (zoom 10+)
* `source`: `openstreetmap.org` or `naturalearthdata.com`
* `sort_rank`: a suggestion for which order to draw features. The value is an integer where smaller numbers suggest that features should be "behind" features with larger numbers.
* `min_zoom`: a suggested minimum zoom at which the boundary line should become visible based on `scalerank` and `min_zoom` value from Natural Earth, and invented for OpenStreetMap, a float.

#### Boundaries properties (common optional):

* `kind:xx`: alternate `kind` according to the viewpoint `XX`. If you want to show features according to a particular viewpoint, then use `kind:xx` if it exists and fall back to `kind` if not. The range of values is the same as for `kind`. Note that the viewpoints are either lower-case [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes or the pseudo-code `iso`.
* `id:left`: For the relation on the left side of the boundary line. This is only provided at zoom 13+.
* `id:right`: For the relation on the right side of the boundary line. This is only provided at zoom 13+.
* `name:left`: See name section above, other variants like `old_name` also supported. _See planned bug fix in [#1102](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1102)._
* `name:right`: See name section above, other variants like `old_name` also supported. _See planned bug fix in [#1102](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1102)._
* `maritime_boundary`: a special Tilezen calculated value loosely coupled with OpenStreetMap's maritime tag, but with spatial buffer processing for lines falling in the ocean.

#### Boundaries properties (optional):

* `osm_relation`: `true`, which can also be deduced from negative `id` values.

#### Boundary `kind` values:

* `aboriginal_lands`
* `country`
* `county`
* `disputed`
* `disputed_breakaway`
* `disputed_claim`
* `disputed_elusive`
* `disputed_reference_line`
* `indefinite`
* `indeterminate`
* `lease_limit`
* `line_of_control`
* `locality`
* `macroregion`
* `map_unit`
* `overlay_limit`
* `region`
* `unrecognized_country`
* `unrecognized_region`

### Viewpoints for Disputed Boundaries

When there is a **boundary dispute** between two countries, the default boundary between them is generally shown according to the _de facto_ status marking where one country's on the ground administration ends and another's begins. The boundary line itself is marked `disputed`, and the extend of the other country's claim is tagged with one of `disputed_breakaway`, `disputed_claim`, `disputed_elusive`, and `disputed_reference_line`.

Audiences in different countries may have different expectations and legal requirements so Tilezen optionally supports _de jure_ boundary viewpoints with `kind:xx` properties, where `xx` is a lower-cased [ISO 3166-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) with support for `ar`, `bd`, `br`, `cn`, `de`, `eg`, `es`, `fr`, `gb`, `gr`, `id`, `il`, `in`, `it`, `jp`, `ko`, `ma`, `nl`, `np`, `pk`, `pl`, `ps`, `pt`, `ru`, `sa`, `se`, `tr`, `tw`, `ua`, `us`, `vn`. Use these properties to "turn off" `unrecognized_country` and `unrecognized_region` boundary lines, and restyle the claims as `country` and `region`. The range of values is the same as for `kind`, and should be used in conjunction with `kind` as `kind:xx` in a coalesce as it's only included when that country's viewpoint is different than the default. These should be paired with **places** layer viewpoint support for country and region capitals.

Some disputed boundaries, like the [China 9-dashed line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-dash_line), are marked `unrecognized_country` by default and are only available in a specific `kind:xx` viewpoint (in this case `kind:cn` and `kind:tw`).

## Buildings and Addresses

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-buildings.png)

* Layer name: `buildings`
* Geometry types: `point` and `polygon`

Polygons from OpenStreetMap representing building footprints, building label placement points, `building_part` features, address points, and entrance and exit points. Starts at zoom 13 by including huge buildings, progressively adding all buildings at zoom 16+. Address points are available at zoom 16+, but marked with `min_zoom: 17` to suggest that they are suitable for display at zoom level 17 and higher.

Individual `building_part` geometries from OpenStreetMap following the [Simple 3D Buildings](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Simple_3D_Buildings) tags at higher zoom levels. Building parts may receive a `root_id` corresponding to the building feature, if any, with which they intersect.

Tilezen calculates the `landuse_kind` value by intercutting `buildings` with the `landuse` layer to determine if a building is over a parks, hospitals, universities or other landuse features. Use this property to modify the visual appearance of buildings over these features. For instance, light grey buildings look great in general, but aren't legible over most landuse colors unless they are darkened (or colorized to match landuse styling).

Label position points may also have `closed` or `historical` `kind_detail` values if the original building name ended in "(closed)" or "(historical)", respectively. These points will have a `min_zoom` of 17, suggesting that they are suitable for display only at high zooms. _See related bug fix in [#1026](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1026)._

Values for `kind_detail`  are sourced from OpenStreetMap's `building` tag for building footprints and from `building:part` tag for building parts.

Note that building geometries, like most geometries in Tilezen tiles, are clipped to the bounds of the tile, even if the building extends beyond the tile. This means that it might be necessary to assemble geometry from several neighbouring tiles to recreate the full building. Some buildings are exceptionally large and span many tiles, so this can be tricky.

#### Building properties (common):

* `name`
* `id`: from OpenStreetMap
* `root_id`: so building parts can be associated back with their "root" building relation
* `kind`: see below
* `kind_detail`: see below
* `source`: `openstreetmap.org`
* `landuse_kind`: See description above, values match values in the `landuse` layer.
* `sort_rank`: a suggestion for which order to draw features. The value is an integer where smaller numbers suggest that features should be "behind" features with larger numbers.
* `min_zoom`: a suggested minimum zoom at which the building should become visible based on area and volume limits.

#### Building properties (common optional):

* `addr_housenumber`: value from OpenStreetMap's `addr:housenumber` tag
* `addr_street`: value from OpenStreetMap's `addr:street` tag
* `area`: in square meters (spherical Mercator, no real-world), `polygon` features only.
* `building_material`: A description of the material covering the outside of the building or building part, if the information is available. Common values are: `brick`, `cement_block`, `clay`, `concrete`, `glass`, `masonry`, `metal`, `mud`, `other`, `permanent`, `plaster`, `sandstone`, `semi-permanent`, `steel`, `stone`, `timber-framing`, `tin`, `traditional` and `wood`, and there are many other less common values.
* `height`: in meters, where available
* `layer`
* `location`: from OpenStreetMap to indicate if building is underground, similar to `layer`.
* `min_height`: value from `min_height` in meters, where available, otherwise estimated from `building:min_levels` if present
* `roof_color`: from `roof:color` tag
* `roof_height`: from `roof:height` tag
* `roof_material`: from `roof:material` tag
* `roof_orientation`: from `roof:orientation` tag
* `roof_shape`: from `roof:shape` tag
* `scale_rank`: calculation of a feature's importance
* `volume`: calculated on feature's `area` and `height`, when `height` or `min_height` is available.

## Earth

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-earth.png)

* Layer name: `earth`
* Geometry types: `polygon`, `line`, `point`.

Polygons representing earth landmass and natural feature lines. Uses coastline-derived land polygons from [osmdata.openstreetmap.de](https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de). Natural lines from OpenStreetMap representing cliffs, aretes. This layer also includes earth `label_placement` lines for ridges and valleys (which should not otherwise be symbolized).

_Uses Natural Earth until zoom 7, then switches to OSM land at zoom 8+._

**Earth properties:**

* `name`: generally only for lines or label placement points
* `id`: The `osm_id` **or** funky value when from Natural Earth or OSMData.OpenStreetMap.de
* `kind`: either `earth` or "natural" value from OSM tag.
* `source`: `openstreetmap.org` or `naturalearthdata.com`
* `sort_rank`: a suggestion for which order to draw features. The value is an integer where smaller numbers suggest that features should be "behind" features with larger numbers.
* `min_zoom`: a suggestion for which zoom to draw a feature. The value is a float. _See planned bug fix in [#1073](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1073)._

#### Earth `kind` values:

* `archipelago` - point, intended for label placement only
* `arete` - line
* `cliff` - line, intended for label placement only
* `continent` - point, intended for label placement only
* `earth` - polygon
* `island` - point, intended for label placement only
* `islet` - point, intended for label placement only
* `ridge` - line, intended for label placement only
* `valley` - line, intended for label placement only

## Landuse

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-landuse.png)

* Layer name: `landuse`
* Geometry types: `point` and `polygon`

Landuse polygons from OpenStreetMap representing parks, forests, residential, commercial, industrial, university, sports and other areas. Includes OpenStreetMap data at higher zoom levels, and [Natural Earth](http://naturalearthdata.com) polygons at lower zoom levels. This layer also includes landuse `label_placement` points for labeling polygons de-duplicated across tile boundaries.

Zooms 4 and 5, 6 and 7 includes a mix of Natural Earth `urban_area` (zooms 0-9 only) features and OpenStreetMap data for `national_park`, `protected_area`, and `nature_reserve` only. After that more more feature kinds are included, and they have a richer set of properties including `sport`, `religion`, `surface`, `attraction`, `zoo`, and `natural`. Feature selection is filtered per zoom until zoom 15.

At mid- and low-zooms, between 4-12, some landuse polygons are merged to reduce payload size. To facilitate this, the name of the landuse area may be dropped for small polygons. When polygons are merged, the original `id` properties are dropped, and the `area` is re-calculated for the new size.

_TIP: Some `landuse` features only exist as point features in OpenStreetMap. Find those in the `pois` layer._

(below) Fence lines around the petting zoo in San Francisco are included in the `landuse` layer.

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-barriers.png)

### Low zoom consolidation

At zoom 12 and below, we consolidate some landuse kinds to reduce the amount of superfluous detail and give adjacent landuse areas a better chance to merge together. This merging allows them to form an appropriately-sized polygon for the zoom level, and avoid the "billion colour patchwork" that comes from keeping each distinct feature.

The current mappings are:

* `airfield` -> `aerodrome`
* `allotments` -> `urban_area`
* `artwork` -> `urban_area`
* `attraction` -> `urban_area`
* `bare_rock` -> `desert`

## Places

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-places.png)

* Layer name: `places`
* Geometry types: `point`

Combination of OpenStreetMap `place` points, Natural Earth populated places, and Who's On First neighbourhoods.

Places with `kind` values of `continent`, `country`, with others added starting at zoom 4 for `region` and starting at zoom 8 for `locality`. Specific `locality` and `region` types are added to the `kind_detail` tag.

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-places-neighbourhoods.png)

**Neighbourhoods:** [Who's On First](http://www.whosonfirst.org/) `neighbourhood` and `macrohood` features are added starting at zoom 12. Neighbourhoods are included one zoom earlier than their `min_zoom`, and stay included 1 zoom past their `max_zoom`.


#### Place properties (common):

* `name`
* `id`: The `osm_id` from OpenStreetMap or Natural Earth id
* `kind`: normalized values between OpenStreetMap and Natural Earth
* `population`: population integer values from OpenStreetMap or Natural Earth's minimum population value(`pop_min`) if the place has a join from OpenStreetMap and NatualEarth or an estimate based on the type of place.
* `population_rank`: A value from 18 down to 0, indicating how large the population is on a particular place. A larger value indicates a bigger population. See "Population Rank" below for more details.
* `source`: `openstreetmap`, `naturalearthdata.com`, or `whosonfirst.org`
* `min_zoom`: a suggested minimum zoom at which the place should become visible based on scalerank and population values from Natural Earth, and invented for OpenStreetMap. Note that this is not an integer, and may contain fractional parts.

#### Place properties (common optional):

* `country_capital`: a `true` value normalizes values between OpenStreetMap and Natural Earth for kinds of `Admin-0 capital`, `Admin-0 capital alt`, and `Admin-0 region capital`.
* `country_capital:xx`: when present, either `true` or `false` to override the `country_capital` value for XX's viewpoint. Note that the viewpoints are either lower-case [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes or the pseudo-code `iso`, same as for `kind:xx` on boundaries.
* `region_capital`: a `true` value normalizes values between OpenStreetMap and Natural Earth for kinds of `Admin-1 capital` and `Admin-1 region capital`.
* `region_capital:xx`: when present, either `true` or `false` to override the `region_capital` value for XX's viewpoint. Note that the viewpoints are either lower-case [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) codes or the pseudo-code `iso`, same as for `kind:xx` on boundaries.
* `max_zoom`: a suggested maximum zoom beyond which the place should not be visible. Currently neighbourhoods only, from Who's On First.
* `is_landuse_aoi`: Currently neighbourhoods only, from Who's On First
* `kind_detail`: the original value of the OSM `place` tag and Natural Earth `featurecla`, see below.
* `wikidata_id`: when present, the [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) ID corresponding to this feature.

#### Place `kind` values:

* `borough`
* `country`
* `locality`
* `macrohood`
* `microhood`
* `neighbourhood`
* `region`

#### Place `kind_detail` values:

Primarily these are available for features of kind `locality` or `region`.

* `city`
* `farm`
* `hamlet`
* `isolated_dwelling`
* `locality`
* `province`
* `scientific_station`
* `state`
* `town`
* `village`

#### Population Rank

The values of population rank are derived from the `population` value as follows:

* 18: Over 1b
* 17: 100m to 1b
* 16: 50m to 100m
* 15: 20m to 50m
* 14: 10m to 20m
* 13: 5m to 10m
* 12: 1m to 5m
* 11: 500k to 1m
* 10: 200k to 500k
* 9: 100k to 200k
* 8: 50k to 100k
* 7: 20k to 50k
* 6: 10k to 20k
* 5: 5k to 10k
* 4: 2k to 5k
* 3: 1k to 2k
* 2: 200 to 1k
* 1: Less than 200
* 0: No `population` value available or `population` value zero.

When available, for the largest cities, OSM localities gets their `population_rank` from NaturalEarth's `pop_max` tag because NaturalEarth `pop_max` is for the metro area and is more useful for label grading in the stylesheet.

## Points of Interest

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-pois.png)

* Layer name: `pois`
* Geometry types: `point`

Over 400 points of interest (POI) kinds are supported. POIs are included starting at zoom 4 for `national_park`, zoom 9 for `park`, and zoom 12 for other major features like `airport`, `hospital`, `zoo`, and `motorway_junction`. Progressively more features are added at each additional zoom based on a combination of feature area (if available) and `kind` value. For instance, by zoom 15 most `police`, `library`, `university`, and `beach` features are included, and by zoom 16 things like `car_sharing`, `picnic_site`, and `tree` are added. By zoom 16 all local features are added, like `amusement_ride`, `atm`, and `bus_stop`, but may be marked with a `min_zoom` property to suggest at which zoom levels they are suitable for display. For example, `bench` and `waste_basket` features may be marked `min_zoom: 18` to suggest that they are displayed at zoom 18 and higher.  Note that `min_zoom` is not an integer, and may contain a fractional component.

NOTE: The `pois` layer includes point "labels" for most polygon features otherwise found in the `landuse` layer (eg: `national_park` and `park`); these points are suitable for drawing as icon-and-text labels. The remaining `label_position` points in the `landuse` layer and `buildings` layer are suitable for text-only labels.

Points of interest from OpenStreetMap, with per-zoom selections similar to the primary [openstreetmap.org carto stylesheet](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).

The range of kinds has expanded to cover nearly all of the basic OpenStreetMap.org cartography, iD editor preset icons, Maki icons, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's map style, and more. Icons are provided in the related Mapzen icon library project.

Features from OpenStreetMap which are tagged `disused=*` for any other value than `disused=no` are not included in the data. Features which have certain parenthetical comments after their name are suppressed until zoom 17 and have their `kind` property set to that comment. Currently anything with a name ending in '(closed)' or '(historical)' will be suppressed in this manner. Railway stops, halts, stations and tram stops from OpenStreetMap tagged with a `historic` tag are also not included in the data.

To resolve inconsistency in data tagging in OpenStreetMap we normalize several operator values for United States National Parks as `United States National Park Service`, several United States Forest Service values as `United States Forest Service`, and several values for New South Wales National Parks in Australia as `National Parks & Wildlife Service NSW`.

#### POI properties (common):

* `name`
* `id`
* `source`: `openstreetmap.org`
* `kind`: combination of the `aerialway`, `aeroway`, `amenity`, `attraction`, `barrier`, `craft`, `highway`, `historic`, `leisure`, `lock`, `man_made`, `natural`, `office`, `power`, `railway`, `rental`, `shop`, `tourism`, `waterway`, and `zoo` tags. Can also be one of `closed` or `historical` if the original feature was parenthetically commented as closed or historical.
* `min_zoom`: a suggested minimum zoom at which the POI should become visible. Note that this is not an integer, and may contain fractional parts.

#### POI properties (common optional):

* `kind_detail`: cuisine, sport
* `attraction`: TODO
* `direction`: generally only for `viewpoint` and other oriented features. Expressed as an integer in range of 0-359, where 0 is equal to north, using a clockwise rotation of the "main" direction.
* `exit_to`: only for highway exits
* `ref`: generally only for `aeroway_gate` and `station_entrance` features
* `religion`: TODO
* `wikidata_id`: when present, the [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) ID corresponding to this feature.
* `zoo`: TODO

#### POI properties (only on `kind:station`):

* `state`: only on `kind:station`, status of the station. Values include: `proposed`, `connection`, `inuse`, `alternate`, `temporary`.
* `*_routes`: a list of the reference name/number or full name (if there is no `ref`) of the OSM route relations which are reachable by exploring the local public transport relations or site relations. These are:
  * `train_routes` a list of train routes, generally above-ground and commuter or inter-city "heavy" rail.
  * `subway_routes` a list of subway or underground routes, generally underground commuter rail.
  * `light_rail_routes` a list of light rail or rapid-transit passenger train routes.
  * `tram_routes` a list of tram routes.
* `is_*` a set of boolean flags indicating whether this station has any routes of the given type. These are: `is_train`, `is_subway`, `is_light_rail`, `is_tram`, corresponding to the above `*_routes`. This is provided as a convenience for styling.
* `root_id` an integer ID (of an OSM relation) which can be used to link or group together features which are related by being part of a larger feature. A full explanation of [relations](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation) wouldn't fit here, but the general idea is that all the station features which are part of the same [site](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:site), [stop area](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:public_transport%3Dstop_area) or [stop area group](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:public_transport) should have the same ID to show they're related. Note that this information is only present on some stations.

#### POI properties (only on `kind:bicycle_rental_station`):

* `capacity`: Approximate number of total rental bicycles at the bike share station.
* `network`: The common (sometimes branded) name of the bike share network, eg: "Citi Bike".
* `operator`: Who actually runs the bike share station, eg: "NYC Bike Share".
* `ref`: The reference of this rental station, if one is available.

#### POI properties (only on `kind:bicycle_parking` and `kind:motorcycle_parking`):

* `access`: Whether the parking is for general public use (`yes`, `permissive`, `public`) or for customers only (`customers`) or private use only (`private`, `no`).
* `capacity`: Approximate number of total bicycle parking spots.
* `covered`: Is the parking area covered.
* `fee`: If present, indicates whether a fee must be paid to use the parking. A value of `true` means a fee must be paid, a value of `false` means no fee is required. If the property is not present, then it is unknown whether a fee is required or not.
* `operator`: Who runs the parking lot.
* `maxstay`: A duration indicating the maximum time a bike is allowed to be parked.
* `surveillance`: If present, then indicates whether there is surveillance. A value of `true` means the parking is covered by surveillance, a value of `false` means it is not. If the property is not present, then it is unknown whether surveillance is in place or not.

#### POI properties (only on `kind:peak` and `kind:volcano`):

* `elevation`: Elevation of the peak or volcano in meters, where available.
* `kind_tile_rank`: A rank of each peak or volcano, with 1 being the most important. Both peaks and volcanos are scored in the same scale. When the zoom is less than 16, only five of these features are included in each tile. At zoom 16, all the features are - although it's rare to have more than 5 peaks in a zoom 16 tile.

#### POI properties (only on `kind:marina`, `kind:camp_site` and `kind:caravan_site`)

* `sanitary_dump_station`: One of `yes`, `customers` or `public` if there are sanitary dump facilities at this location, and who is permitted to use them.

#### POI properties (only on `charging_station`):

* `bicycle`, `scooter`, `car`, `truck`: True, false, or omitted based on if that type of vehicle can be charged, or if the information is not present

#### POI properties (only on `quary`, `wharf`):

* `mooring` with values: `no`, `yes`, `commercial`, `cruise`, `customers`, `declaration`, `ferry`, `guest`, `private`, `public`, `waiting`, `yacht` or `yachts`.

## Roads (Transportation)

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-roads.png)

* Layer name: `roads`
* Geometry types: `line`, `point`

More than just roads, this OpenStreetMap and Natural Earth based transportation layer includes highways, major roads, minor roads, paths, railways, ferries, and ski pistes matching the selection found in High Road. Sort them with `sort_rank` to correctly represent layered overpasses, bridges and tunnels. Natural Earth roads at zooms < 8 and OpenStreetMap at zooms 8+. See zoom ranges section below for more information per kind.

Road names are **abbreviated** so directionals like `North` is replaced with `N`, `Northeast` is replaced with `NE`, and common street suffixes like `Avenue` to `Ave.` and `Street` to `St.`. Full details in the [StreetNames](https://github.com/nvkelso/map-label-style-manual/blob/master/tools/street_names/StreetNames/__init__.py) library.

Tilezen calculates the `landuse_kind` value by intercutting `roads` with the `landuse` layer to determine if a road segment is over a parks, hospitals, universities or other landuse features. Use this property to modify the visual appearance of roads over these features. For instance, light grey minor roads look great in general, but aren't legible over most landuse colors unless they are darkened.

To improve performance, some road segments are merged at low and mid-zooms. To facilitate this, certain properties are dropped at those zooms. Examples include `is_bridge` and `is_tunnel`, `name`, `network`, `oneway`, and `ref`. The exact zoom varies per feature class (major roads keep this properties over a wider range, minor roads drop them starting at zoom 14). When roads are merged, the original OSM `id` values are dropped.

#### Road properties (common):

* `name`: From OpenStreetMap, but transformed to abbreviated names as detailed above.
* `id`: From OpenStreetMap or Natural Earth. Dropped at low- and mid-zooms when features are merged. _See planned bug fix [#1002](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/1002)._
* `source`: `openstreetmap` or `naturalearthdata.com`
* `kind`: one of High Road's values for `highway`, `major_road`, `minor_road`, `rail`, `path`, `ferry`, `piste`, `aerialway`, `aeroway`, `racetrack`, `portage_way`, `construction`.
* `kind_detail`: See kind detail list below, sourced from the OpenStreetMap values.
* `landuse_kind`: See description above, values match values in the `landuse` layer.
* `sort_rank`: a suggestion for which order to draw features. The value is an integer where smaller numbers suggest that features should be "behind" features with larger numbers. At zooms >= 15, the `sort_rank` is adjusted to realistically model bridge, tunnel, and layer ordering.
* `min_zoom`: a suggestion for which zoom to draw a feature. The value is a float.
* `ref`: Commonly-used reference for roads, for example "I 90" for Interstate 90. To use with shields, see `network` and `shield_text`. Related, see `symbol` for pistes.
* `all_networks` and `all_shield_texts`: All the networks of which this road is a part, and all of the shield texts. See `network` and `shield_text` below. **Note** that these properties will not be present on MVT format tiles, as we cannot currently encode lists as values.
* `network`: eg: `US:I` for the United States Interstate network, useful for shields and road selections. This only contains _road_ network types. Please see `bicycle_network` and `walking_network` for bicycle and walking networks, respectively. Note that networks may include "modifier" information, for example `US:I:Business` for a business route or `US:I:Truck` for a truck route. The whitelist of "modifier" values is; `Alternate`, `Business`, `Bypass`, `Connector`, `Historic`, `Scenic`, `Spur`, `Toll` and `Truck`.
* `shield_text`: Contains text to display on a shield. For example, I 90 would have a `network` of `US:I` and a `shield_text` of `90`. The `ref`, `I 90`, is less useful for shield display without further processing. For some roads, this can include non-numeric characters, for example the M1 motorway in the UK will have a `shield_text` of `M1`, rather than just `1`. Whitepsace, punctuation, and prefixes are generally stripped.
* `shield_text_length`: The length of the `shield_text` field as a string.  E.g. if `shield_text` is `'12345'`, `shield_text_length` would be `'5'`. Missing if `shield_text` is !(0 < length < 7) or field doesn't exist

#### Road Transportation `hgv_time_restrictions` Values
Property specifies date and time period during which the condition applies. Value is a string in the Time Domain format. Time Domain is part of the GDF(Geographic Data Files) specification which is an ISO standard. Current standard is GDF 5.1 which is ISO 20524-1:2020.

A basic Time Domain is the combination of a Starting Date and a Time Duration with the following notation: `[(Starting Date) {Time duration}]`. For example, `[(M5d1){d1}]` means: Starting Date: any year, month 5 (May), day 1st, at 0:00 a.m. Duration: 1 complete day (i.e., 24 hours or 1440 minutes).

Starting Dates and time intervals are defined by means of a set of graphical symbols allowing the description of years, months, weeks, days, and so on down to the smallest time unit, which is the second. The symbols have to be organized in a sequential order starting with the longest time unit. Attached to a starting date, the interval constitutes a basic Time Domain. Without a starting date, it just indicates a duration. If the very first time type code in duration section is preceded by a minus sign, it means that the duration is counted in the reverse order. The following list describes starting date and time interval unit types:

* `ynn` - Year. Defines either a particular nnnn year in a starting date; or a duration of nn years. For example, `[(y1991M11d14h5m30s19){y1}]` means from 14 November 1991, 5:30:19 a.m. to 14 November 1992, 5:30:19 a.m. If there is no identical calendar date in the year in question, which occurs only for 29 February, “plus 1 year” leads to 28 February of the following year. Notice that `{y1}` = `{M12}`
* `Mnn` - Month. Defines either a particular month (1 to 12) within a particular year, or any year when no `y` information is given in starting date; or a duration of nn months. For example, `[(y1991M11d14h5m30s19) {M3}]` means from 14 November 1991, 5:31:19 a.m. to 14 February 1992, 5:30:19 a.m.
* `wnn` - Week. Defines either a week (1 to 53) within a previously defined year, or any year when no `y` information is given in a starting date; or a duration of nn weeks, i.e., nn*7 days. For example, `[(y1991M11d14h5m30s19) {w2}]` means from 14 November 1991 at 5:30:19 a.m. to 28 November 1991, 5:30:19 a.m. Notice that `{w1}` = `{d7}`
* `dnn` - Day. Defines either a particular day (1 to 28, 29, 30, 31) within a particular month if previously defined with the `M` format in a starting date; or a duration of nn days, i.e., nn*24 hours. For example, `[(y1991M11d14h5m30s19) {d2}]` means from 14 November 1991 at 5:30:19 a.m. to 16 November 1991, 5:30:19 a.m. Notice that `{d1}` = `{h24}`
* `tn` - Day. Only in starting date defines a particular weekday (`1`:Sunday, `2`:Monday, `3`:Tuesday, `4`:Wednesday, `5`:Thursday, `6`:Friday, `7`:Saturday) in a previously (if any) defined week. For example, `(M5t2)` means each Monday in the fifth month (May) of any year, at 0:00:00 a.m.
* `fxn` - Day. Only in starting date defines a particular weekday in a previously (if any) defined month, with the following rules: n is used as in the “t” format with the same domain of values, `1`:Sunday up to `7`:Saturday. For “x” one of the following values has to be substituted: `1`:first, `2`:second, `3`:third, `4`:fourth, `5`:fifth. For example: `(...f12)` means the first Monday at 0:00:00 a.m.
* `lxn` - Day. Only in starting date defines a particular weekday in a previously (if any) defined month, with the following rules: n is used as for the “t” format with the same domain of values, `1`:Sunday up to `7`:Saturday. x has to be chosen from the following set: `1`:first, `2`:second, `3`:third, `4`:fourth, `5`:fifth. Values are given in reverse order starting from the end of the month and have the meaning: `1`=last, `2`=last but one, `3`= last but two, etc. For example, `(...l12)` means the last Monday at 0:00:00 a.m.
* `hnn` - Hour. Defines either a particular hour (0 to 23) within a particular day (if previously defined) in a starting date; or a duration of nn hours, i.e., nn*60 minutes. For example, `[(y1991M11d14h5m30s19) {h10}]` means from 14 November 1991, 5:30:19 a.m. to 14 November 1991 at 3:30:19 p.m. Notice that `{h1}` = `{m60}`
* `mnn` - Minute. Defines either a particular minute (0 to 59) within a particular hour (if previously defined) in a starting date; or a duration of nn minutes, i.e., nn*60 seconds. For example, `[(y1991M11d14h5m30s19) {m11}]` means from 14 November 1991 at 5:30:19 a.m. to 14 November 1991 at 5:41:19 a.m. Notice that `{m1}` = `{s60}`
* `snn` - Second. Defines either a particular second (0 to 59) within a particular minute (if previously defined) in a starting date; or a duration of nn seconds. For example, `[(y1991M11d14h5m30s19) {s21}]` means from 14 November 1991 at 5:30:19 a.m. to 14 November 1991 at 5:30:40 a.m. Notice that `{m1}` = `{s60}`
* `znn` - Fuzzy symbols for special time terms. Currently only 2 variants are used: `[(z1){z51}]` means dawn til dusk (nighttime) and `[(z2){z52}]` means dusk til dawn (daytime). May be extended in future
* `string_value` - Externally specified string value. For example `[*EASTER(h8){h14}]` means from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm during Easter

Starting Dates which are composed of several time units (e.g., 14 November 1991) are defined by placing the symbols sequentially in a hierarchical order.

Time periods (duration) which are composed of several time interval units are represented by listing the individual symbols sequentially in hierarchical order. The total time duration of a particular combination of symbols is the sum of all single time intervals. For example, `{y2M1w2}` means a period of 2 years, 1 month, and 2 weeks. Since Time Domains can be considered as a set of the smallest time unit described here, the second, Time Domains may also be combined with set operations, such as:

* Union of sets notation: `+`
* Intersection of sets notation: `*`
* Subtraction of sets notation: `-`

All the Time Domain strings are stored in prefix form: it uses the polish/prefix operator notation and omit brackets made redundant by this. For example:
`[[(d1){w1}]-[(d3){d1}]]` has prefix form `-(d1){w1}(d3){d1}`
`[[(d1){w1}]*[(d3){-w1}]]` has prefix form `*(d1){w1}(d3){-w1}`


#### Roads layer network values

Any road with `shield_text` will include a `network` property with a value like `AA:bcdef` where `AA` is a 2-character country code, followed by a `:` separator, and `bcdef` category value which either indicates the "region" (state or province) or "level" of the road network. There are exceptions to this for trans-national networks like `e-road`. In some cases, like the United States and Canada an additional _modifier_ to appended to indicate `Truck` and other alternate routes, or further network disambiguation.

When a network value can't be determined from the upstream data source we calculate where the road is located and provide the relevant 2-char country code as the network value. See table below for mapping of country codes to country names.

Tilezen normalizes upstream data sources to well known values. While it's common for OpenStreetMap to include road network relations in the United States and Canada, most other countries lack this information and we [synthesize Tilezen network values from OpenStreetMap](roads-network-values-openstreetmap.md) from a combination of network, ref, and country spatial joins.

#### Roads surface values simplification

At lower zooms,

* 14 or lower for `minor_road`,
* 12 or lower for `path` and
* 11 or lower for `major_road`

The range of `surface` values is simplified to just 3: `paved`, `compacted` or `unpaved`. The detailed range of values is mapped down as follows:

* `asphalt`, `metal`, `metal_grid`, `paved`, `tartan`, `wood` are simplified to `paved`.
* `concrete`, `paving_stones`, `sett` are simplified to `compacted`.
* `artificial_turf`, `clay`, `cobblestone`, `cobblestone_flattened`, `concrete_lanes`, `concrete_plates`, `decoturf`, `dirt`, `earth`, `fine_gravel`, `grass`, `grass_paver`, `gravel`, `ground`, `mud`, `pebblestone`, `salt`, `sand`, `woodchips` are simplified to `unpaved`.

## Transit

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-transit.png)

* Layer name: `transit`
* Geometry types: `line`, `polygon`

Transit line features from OpenStreetMap start appearing at zoom 5+ for national trains, with regional trains addded at zoom 6+. Then `subway`,`light_rail`, and `tram` are added at zoom 10+. `funicular` and `monorail` features are added at zoom 12+. Platform polygons are added zoom 14+.

_TIP: If you're looking for transit `station` and `station_entrance` features, look in the `pois` layer instead._

#### Transit properties (common):

* `name`: including localized name variants
* `id`: OpenStreetMap feature `osm_id`
* `kind`: detailed below, per geometry type
* `source`: `openstreetmap.org`
* `sort_rank`: a suggestion for which order to draw features. The value is an integer where smaller numbers suggest that features should be "behind" features with larger numbers.
* `min_zoom`: a suggestion for which zoom to draw a feature. The value is a float.

#### Transit properties (common optional):

Depending on upstream OpenStreetMap tagging, the following properties may be present:

* `ref`
* `network`
* `operator`
* `railway`
* `route`

A smaller set is also available for non-`platform` features:

* `colour`: either a `#rrggbb` hex value, or a CSS colour name (like `red`)
* `colour_name`: A colour name from a fixed palette, see description below.
* `layer`
* `state`
* `symbol`
* `type`

#### Transit properties (optional):

Depending on OpenStreetMap tagging, the following properties may be present for non-`platform` features.

* `ascent`
* `descent`
* `description`
* `distance`
* `roundtrip`

#### Transit `kind` values (line, polygon):

* `light_rail`
* `platform`
* `railway`
* `subway`
* `train`
* `tram`

#### Transit `colour_name` values:

Transit lines may have their colours mapped onto one of these CSS colours. The intention is that designers can take this limited palette set and remap them onto a set which is more appropriate and in keeping with the other colours in the design.

## Traffic Flow

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-traffic-flow.png)

This **optional** layer is meant to be updated every few minutes, due to the highly dynamic nature of the data. Consideration should be given to rendering the features from this layer linked to the **roads** layer when linear referencing is available, or as an overlay

* Layer name: `traffic_flow`
* Geometry types: `line`

#### `common` properties:

* `id`: Unique traffic event ID. Can be referenced when checking for updated traffic information for specified event
* `kind`: the **severity** of the flow information as seen by traffic provider to indicate the traffic "color"
* `min_zoom`: this value is derived from combination of `road_kind`, `kind`, and `kind_detail` values. A suggestion for which zoom to draw a feature. The value is a float

#### Possible `kind` values for traffic flow:

* `unknown`: traffic status unknown
* `free`: Free flowing, not disturbed, traffic
* `minor`: Minor traffic
* `slow`: Slowly moving traffic
* `queuing`: The traffic is in queues but still moves slowly
* `stationary`: Stationary traffic, congestion
* `none`: No traffic flow due to blockage or closure

#### `common-optional` properties:

* `source`: provider of traffic information
* `congestion`: the level of traffic flow, with 0.0 representing completely free flowing traffic to 1.0 completely congested traffic
* `speed`: speed in km/h
* `drives_on_left`: set to `true` when the country drives on the left, e.g. In the U.K
* `sort_rank`: a suggestion for which order to draw flow features. The value is an integer where smaller numbers suggest that features should be "behind" features with larger numbers

#### `optional` properties:

If the roads layer features include `linear_ref_id`, then traffic flow layer features may include the following, in which case the traffic data should be delivered without geometry and run-time linked with the roads layer.

* `linear_ref_id`: identifier link to a linear references system, eg [SharedStreet](https://github.com/sharedstreets/sharedstreets-ref-system/blob/master/OSMLR.md).

However, if the roads layer does not include `linear_ref_id`, then it should be delivered with geometry and the following properties to enable sizing and layering of the traffic overlay with respect to the roads network:

* `road_kind`: [kind of the road](#road-properties-common)
* `road_kind_detail`: [kind_detail of the road](#road-properties-common)
* `is_bridge`: set to `true` when the linear is a bridge
* `is_tunnel`: set to `true` when the linear is a tunnel
* `is_link`: set to true when the linear is a slip-road
* `is_hov_lane`: set to `true` when the linear is an HOV (High-Occupancy Vechicle) express lane
* `network`: 2-character country code and optional region (eg. `DE:BS`) of the traffic information (See: [Roads Layer Network Values](#roads-layer-network-values))

## Traffic Incidents

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-traffic-incidents.png)

This **optional** layer is meant to be updated every few minutes, due to the highly dynamic nature of the information contained within this layer. Consideration should be given to rendering the features from this layer either linked to the **roads** layer for linear geometries or as an overlay, and always as an overlay for point geometries

* Layer name: `traffic_incidents`
* Geometry types: `line`, `point`

#### `common` properties:

* `id`: Unique traffic event ID. Can be referenced when checking for updated traffic information for specified event
* `kind`: type of the incident
* `min_zoom`: this value is derived from the `warning_level`. A suggestion for which zoom to draw a feature. The value is a float

#### Possible values for the incident `kind` are:

* `accident`: there has been a collision
* `congestion`: there has been a build up of vehicles
* `construction`: building or roadworks are taking place
* `disabled_vehicle`: a vehicle is unable to move and is obstructing the road
* `mass_transit`: a large amount of people are migrating from one location to another
* `planned_event`: an organised event is taking place causing disruption
* `road_closure`: the road has been closed, e.g. police presence
* `road_hazard`: there are dangerous objects on the surface of the road
* `weather`: weather conditions are causing disruptions
* `other`: an incident not explainable with the labels above has occurred

#### `common-optional` properties:

* `source`: provider of traffic information
* `sort_rank`: a suggestion for which order to draw flow features (for traffic incident line geometries only). The value is an integer where smaller numbers suggest that features should be "behind" features with larger numbers
* `start_time`: the time the incident begins/begun as [unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). At least one of the `start_time` or `stop_time` must be set
* `stop_time`: the time the incident ends/ended as [unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). At least one of the `start_time` or `stop_time` must be set
* `title`: a short description of the incident, localized, such as `title:en` for English and `title:de` for German. Could be used for a title of a pop-up shown in the screen
* `description`: potentially long description and comment on the incident. Localized, like `title` mentioned above

#### `optional` properties:

* `warning_level`: the severity of the incident that has occured, with three possible values: `low` (least severer), `minor`, `major`, and `critical` (most severer).

If the roads layer features include `linear_ref_id`, then traffic incidents layer features may include the following, in which case the traffic data should be delivered without geometry and run-time linked with the roads layer.

* `linear_ref_id`: identifier link to a linear references system, eg [SharedStreet](https://github.com/sharedstreets/sharedstreets-ref-system/blob/master/OSMLR.md).

However, if the roads layer does not include `linear_ref_id`, then it should be delivered with geometry and the following properties to enable sizing and layering of the traffic overlay with respect to the roads network:

* `road_kind`: [kind of the road](#road-properties-common)
* `road_kind_detail`: [kind_detail of the road](#road-properties-common)
* `is_bridge`: set to `true` when the linear is a bridge
* `is_tunnel`: set to `true` when the linear is a tunnel
* `is_link`: set to true when the linear is a slip-road
* `drives_on_left`: set to `true` when the country drives on the left (e.g. in the United Kingdom)
* `is_hov_lane`: set to `true` when the linear is, or the incident affects, a HOV (High-Occupancy Vechicle) express lane
* `network`: 2-character country code and optional region (eg. `DE:BS`) of the traffic information (See: [Roads Layer Network Values](#roads-layer-network-values))

## Water

![image](images/mapzen-vector-tile-docs-water.png)

* Layer name: `water`
* Geometry types: `point`, `line`, and `polygon`

Water `polygons` representing oceans, riverbanks and lakes. Derived from a combination of the `waterway`, `natural`, and `landuse` OpenStreetMap tags. Includes coastline-derived water polygons from [osmdata.openstreetmap.de](https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de) and inland water directly from OpenStreetMap at higher zoom levels 8+, and [Natural Earth](http://naturalearthdata.com) polygons at lower zoom levels (0-7). Water polygons are progressively added based on an area filter until all water is shown at zoom 16+. Covered water is not included.

Also includes water `line` geometries for river and stream centerlines and "label_position" `points` for labeling polygons de-duplicated across tile boundaries. OpenStreetMap sourced waterway lines with kinds of `river`, and `canal` with the tag `boat` = `yes` (aka navigable canals) are included starting at zoom 9, `stream` and other `canal` features are included starting at zoom 11, and `ditch`, `drain` (zoom 16+).

Tilezen calculates the composite exterior edge for overlapping water polygons and marks the resulting line `boundary=true`. Set to `true` when present on `line` geometry, or from Natural Earth line source.

#### Water properties (common):

* `name`: including localized name variants
* `kind`: detailed below, per geometry type
* `source`: one of `naturalearthdata.com`, `osmdata.openstreetmap.de`, `openstreetmap.org`
* `boundary`: `true`, on lines only. See description above. _See proposed bug fix in [#735](https://github.com/tilezen/vector-datasource/issues/735)._
* `sort_rank`: a suggestion for which order to draw features. The value is an integer where smaller numbers suggest that features should be "behind" features with larger numbers.
* `min_zoom`: a suggestion for which zoom to draw a feature. The value is a float.

#### Water properties (common optional):

* `area`: in square meters (spherical Mercator, no real-world), `polygon` features only
* `id`: OpenStreetMap feature `osm_id`, when sourced from `openstreetmap.org`
* `is_tunnel`: for `line` features only (`true` values only)
* `wikidata_id`: when present, the [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) ID corresponding to this feature.
* `alkaline`: boolean
* `intermittent`: boolean
* `reservoir`: boolean

#### Water `kind` values:

* `basin` - polygon
* `bay` - point, intended for label placement only. With `tile_kind_rank`, see below.
* `canal` - line, can also indicate `boat: true` when navigable by a vessel
* `ditch` - line
* `dock` - polygon
* `drain` - line
* `fjord` - point, intended for label placement only. With `tile_kind_rank`, see below.
* `fountain` - polygon
* `lake` - polygon
* `ocean` - polygon, point is intended for label placement only
* `playa` - polygon
* `reef` - polygon. A solid feature just under the surface of the ocean, usually made from rock, sand or coral. If known, the `kind_detail` will be given as one of `coral`, `rock`, `sand`.
* `river` - line
* `riverbank` - polygon
* `sea` - point, intended for label placement only
* `stream` - line
* `strait` - point, intended for label placement only. With `tile_kind_rank`, see below.
* `swimming_pool` - polygon
* `water` - polygon

#### Water `kind_detail` values:

When `water` polygons are sourced from OpenStreetMap, we add `kind_detail` values in an allowlist.

* `basin`
* `canal`
* `ditch`
* `drain`
* `lake` - remap of lake, lagoon, oxbow, pond, reservoir, and wastewater source values
* `river`
* `stream`

Additionally, a `reservoir: true` or `alkaline: true` value can be present on the appropriate `kind=lake` features. Intermittent water features that sometimes run dry or disappear seasonally are marked `intermittent: true` (including implied infiltration and detention features).

The kinds `bay`, `strait` and `fjord` are ranked by size and given a `kind_tile_rank` property that starts from 1 and counts up as the feature gets smaller. Note that the ranking is done on a "metatile", which means that each tile (of size 256px, 512px or other) won't necessarily contain the full range from 1 to N of `kind_tile_rank`s.

**Gotchas:**

* `lake` features with `alkaline: true` and `playa` features are sourced from Natural Earth at low zooms and are sparesly populated at high zooms from OpenStreetMap. Zooming in, your feature may disappear (when there is no equivalent in OpenStreetMap), or the feature may still exist as a water or lake polygon but without the alkaline indicator. Beware the desert around Great Salt Lake in Utah!
* `lake` features from Natural Earth sometimes change to `water` features on zoom into OpenStreetMap data. To work around this, also use `kind_detail` at high zooms.
* Some of the minor kinds (like `bay`, `strait`, and `fjord`) are used for label_placement points only, as their area would duplicate water polygons already present from osmdata.openstreetmap.de.
