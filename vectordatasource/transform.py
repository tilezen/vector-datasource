# CountryNetworkLogic centralises the logic around country-specific road
# network processing. this allows us to do different things, such as
# back-filling missing network tag values or sorting networks differently
# based on which country they are in. (e.g: in the UK, an "M" road is more
# important than an "A" road, even though they'd sort the other way
# alphabetically).
#
# the different logic sections are:
#
# * backfill: this is called as fn(tags) to unpack the ref tag (and any other
#             meaningful tags) into a list of (network, ref) tuples to use
#             instead. For example, it's common to give ref=A1;B2;C3 to
#             indicate multiple networks & shields.
#
# * fix: this is called as fn(network, ref) and should fix whatever problems it
#        can and return the replacement (network, ref). remember! either
#        network or ref can be None!
#
# * sort: this is called as fn(network, ref) and should return a numeric value
#         where lower numeric values mean _more_ important networks.
#
# * shield_text: this is called as fn(network, ref) and should return the
#                shield text to output. this might mean stripping leading alpha
#                numeric characters - or not, depending on the country.
